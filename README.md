# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
### <br />This repo includes:
<br />1) a tidy data set: tidy.txt, 
<br />2) a script for performing the analysis: run_analysis.R
<br />3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work: CodeBook.md
###<br />run_analysis.R does the following:
<br />1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
<br />2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
<br />3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
<br />4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
<br />5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
